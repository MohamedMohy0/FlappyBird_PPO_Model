# 🐦 Flappy Bird PPO Agent

This project trains a **Reinforcement Learning agent** to play **Flappy Bird** using the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm from [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).  

The agent learns by interacting with the [Flappy Bird Gymnasium Environment](https://pypi.org/project/flappy-bird-gymnasium/), and can be evaluated in real time after training.

## 🚀 Features
- Train PPO agent with custom neural network architecture.  
- Save & load the best model automatically using callbacks.  
- Evaluate and test the trained model.  
- Visualize gameplay in real time.  
- TensorBoard logging for monitoring training progress.
